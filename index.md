I am a senior at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, CA.

I maintain a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd8hTfZHh_n0LqAocn8IXTw) site where I have some expository lectures on
various math and physics topics.

I have attended advanced math lectures by Dr.Simon Rubenstein-Salzado on various math topics (Ergodic Theory, Analytic Number Theory). I wrote two expository papers at the end of these sessions.

* [Applications of Fourier Analysis in Ergodic Systems](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/ergodictheory/krishna-rushil-fourier.pdf)
* [Explicit Formulae For &Psi;(z) and &pi;(z)](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/analyticnt/krishna-explicit.pdf)

My CV can be found [here](/cv.pdf)
