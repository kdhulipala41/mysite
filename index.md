I am a senior at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, CA.

I maintain a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd8hTfZHh_n0LqAocn8IXTw]) site where I have some expository lectures on
various math topics.

I have attended advanced math lectures by Dr.Simon Rubenstein-Salzado on various math topics (Ergodic Theory, Analytic Number Theory). I wrote two expository papers at the end of these sessions.

My CV can be found [here](/cv.pdf)
